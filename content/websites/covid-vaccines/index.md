I developed the algorithms for the backend of the website, contributed in planning the layout of the website, designed and developed the data visualizations for the [sentiment plot](https://ailab.uniud.it/covid-vaccines/#sentiment-plot).

I also created all the graphics found in the [project description](https://ailab.uniud.it/covid-vaccines/project-description), such as the one below, which summarizes all the developed software components.
