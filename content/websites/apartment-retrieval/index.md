In 2024, we organized a Metaverse Apartment Retrieval Challenge, co-located with the [3rd CV4Metaverse workshop](../cv4metaverse).

The page was extremely simple, so I sketched a draft using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), exported the html skeleton, cleaned it from all the extra frills, edited the css to make it match the CV4Metaverse website, and called it a day. I admit that I did have a bit too much fun with the Fontawesome icons... but the page needed a little bit of color and pizzaz :)
