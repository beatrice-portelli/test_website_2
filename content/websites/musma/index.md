I'm one of the researchers involved in MUSMA, a project involving the University of Udine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, and the University of Rome "La Sapienza". Its objective is developing new technologies for analyzing multimedia content on social media, how (mis)information spreads through the content, and how people react to it.

I've designed a simple clean site on google sites, shared with the other collaborators, to keep track of the objectives and [achievements](https://sites.google.com/view/musma/publications) of the project.
