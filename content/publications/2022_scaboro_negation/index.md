abstract: |
  Adverse Drug Event (ADE) extraction from user-generated content has gained popularity as a tool to aid researchers and pharmaceutical companies to monitor side effect of drugs in the wild. Automatic models can rapidly examine large collections of social media texts. However it is currently unknown if such models are robust in face of linguistic phenomena such as negation and speculation, which are pervasive across language varieties. We evaluate three state-of-the-art systems, showing their fragility against negation, and then we introduce two possible strategies to increase the robustness of these models: (i) a pipeline approach, using a specific component for negation detection; (ii) an augmentation of the dataset with artificially negated samples to further train the models. We show that both strategies bring significant increases in performance.
