abstract: |
  This paper presents an overview of the current research project on the detection of Adverse Drug Events from social media texts led by the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of Udine (AILAB Udine). In the latest years, patients started reporting Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) on social media and similar online outlets, making it necessary to monitor them for pharmacovigilance purposes. For this reason, systems for the automatic extraction of ADEs are becoming an important research topic in the Natural Language Processing community. In this paper we present our research project, focused on the Detection, Extraction and Normalization of ADEs, detailing its objectives, achievements and future directions.
