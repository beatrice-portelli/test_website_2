abstract: Museums play a central role in the preservation and communication of human history. With the advent of powerful and accessible Virtual Reality technologies, new Metaverse Museums started being developed, creating new possibilities for discovering and experiencing knowledge from all over the world. In anticipation of this technology becoming more widely adopted, we must prepare tools to aid future visitors in finding and navigating the museums and exhibitions which are more relevant to their current interests. In this light, Deep Learning methods could be of great use for modeling Metaverse museums, retrieving the most relevant ones, and creating personalized tours of the artifacts contained within them. In this paper, we present our research project, "Personalized Museum Tours in the Metaverse" led by the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of Udine (AILAB Udine), detailing its objectives, proposed methodology, and future directions.
