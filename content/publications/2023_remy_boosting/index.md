abstract: |
  Biomedical entity linking, also known as biomedical concept normalization, has recently witnessed the rise to prominence of zero-shot contrastive models. However, the pre-training material used for these models has, until now, largely consisted of specialist biomedical content such as MIMIC-III clinical notes and PubMed papers. While the resulting in-domain models have shown promising results for many biomedical tasks, adverse drug event normalization on social media texts has so far remained challenging for them. In this paper, we propose a new approach for adverse drug event normalization on social media relying on general-purpose model initialization via BioLORD and a semantictext-similarity fine-tuning named STS. Our experimental results on several social media datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, by achieving state-of-theart performance. Based on its strong performanceacross all the tested datasets, we believe this work could emerge as a turning point for the task of adverse drug event normalization on social media and has the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research in the field.
